/* 0-1 Knapsack
Problem Description
Given two integer arrays A and B of size N each which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively.
Also given an integer C which represents knapsack capacity.
Find out the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.
NOTE:
You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^3
1 <= C <= 10^3
1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 10^3

Input Format
First argument is an integer array A of size N denoting the values on N items.
Second argument is an integer array B of size N denoting the weights on N items.
Third argument is an integer C denoting the knapsack capacity.
Output Format
Return a single integer denoting the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.

TC = O(N*C) where N is number of happiness and C is the Knapsack capacity
SC= O(C)
